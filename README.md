Pokemon-Data
============

All Unova Pokémon's data from the Kalos National Pokédex.

A bunch of json files that are easy to parse, automatically generated from veekun's csv files and pokecheck's sprite page. Some of it looks a bit cryptic, though.

(It's not really mine, so ignore the license file. Everything belongs to Nintendo / The Pokemon Company / Gamefreak / Whatever*)

*Does not really belong to Whatever. And probably not Gamefreak either.
